Hi! I'm **Shiyan Liu**, a senior at Huazhong University and Science and Technology (HUST) majoring in Data Science & Big Data Technology. I'm also a prospective MSc Computing(AI&ML) student at Imperial starting 2026 Fall. Now I'm studying at UC Berkeley as a visiting student during 2026 Spring.

My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and data science. My prior reseach experiences focused on deep reinforcement learning and agentic AI systems. I look forward to collaborating with fellow researchers and contributing to the frontiers of AI.
