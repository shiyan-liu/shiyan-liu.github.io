## About failure
什么叫失败？也许可以说，人去做一件事情，没有达到预的目的，这就是失败。但是，那些与命运斗争的人，那些做接近自己限度的斗争的人，却天生地接近这种失败。只有那些安于自己限度之内的生活的人オ总是“胜利”，这种“胜利者”之所以常胜不败，只是因为他的对手是早已降伏的，或者说，他根本没有投入斗争。
在人生的道路上，“失败”这个词还有另外的含义，即是指人失去了继续斗争的信心，放下了手中的武器。人类向限度屈服，这才是真正的失败。

What is failure? Perhaps it can be said that when a person undertakes a task and fails to achieve the intended outcome, that is failure. Yet those who struggle against fate, those who fight at the very edge of their limits, are inherently close to this kind of failure. Only those who content themselves with living within their own limits are always “victorious.” The reason such “victors” remain undefeated is simply that their opponents have long been subdued—or rather, they never truly engage in the struggle at all.
On life's journey, the word “failure” carries another meaning: it signifies the loss of confidence to continue the fight, the laying down of one's weapons. When humanity yields to its limitations, that is true failure.

## About trying
You may fail if you try, you'll **definitely** fail if you don't even try. No harm to try!!
